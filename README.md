## Introduction
This goes over some big picture algorithm strategies, data structure implementation, sorting, searching, etc.  

Note, this goes through this course, which is pretty good for reviewing core DSA fundamentals - https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/

## General Notes on Problem-Solving Strageties

Steps to solve a problem:

1.	Understand the problem. 

  *	Before writing code: Restate the problem in my own words.

  *	What are the inputs that go into the problem.

  *	What kind of inputs?   For ex., large numbers, Upper vs lower case, explore empty inputs, examples about edge cases, bad inputs.

  *	What are the outputs that should come out of the problem?

  *	Can the outputs be determined from the inputs

  *	How should I label important pieces of data in this problem?

2.	Explore Concrete examples

  *	Before writing code: I.e., a concrete and simple input / test case.  

  *	Then progress to more complex examples.

  *	Empty inputs? Then what happens? 

  *	Invalid inputs?

  *	Write out this input and output.

3.	Break it down

  *	Before writing code: Write game plan out.  Write comments for everything I want to do.  All the steps:

`// make empty object to return at end`

`// loop over string and add chars to object`

`// return object.`


4.	Solve / Simplify 
  *	Start Coding.  If you can’t, solve a simpler problem as a way to get to the bigger problem. 
5.	Look Back and Refactor.
  *	Check result
  *	Can you derive result differently?
  *	Can you understand it at a glance? Are there parts that are confusing?
  *	Can you use result / method for some other problem?
  *	Can you improve the performance of your solution?
  *	Can you think of other ways to refactor?
  *	Aesthetics – i.e., using for of, instead of a for I = 0; I < s.length; i++;
  *	Say things more compactly.
  *	How have other people solved the problem?
